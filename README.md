# iMoan
iMoan provides the ultimate solution for robbery prevention of your ```Mac OS X``` devices (now includes stationary computers).
Run iMoan, put your Mac into sleep mode, and wait for an unsuspecting thief to awaken the device.

## 1. Installation and run
```sh
make
bash -c "cd bin && ./iMoan"
```

## 2. Configuration
If you do not want to make any changes in the source code, just override the waveform file in the ```bin``` directory.

## 3. Roadmap
- Make the application to run as a background service.
- Configuration file to specify user definable waveforms.
- Make platform independent.
- Write unit tests.
